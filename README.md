## Professional Experience

### Siemens Energy — Junior Data Scientist (NLP)  
*Master’s Thesis · Jul 2025 – Present · Erlangen, Germany*

- Designed and implemented a **production-ready multi-agent AI framework** using LangChain v1 and LangGraph, supporting multiple LLM providers with dynamic hot-swapping.
- Architected **hierarchical agent orchestration** via MCP servers, enabling coordinated planning, reasoning, and execution across specialized agents.
- Integrated agentic AI into **Terminal Management Systems (TMS)** to automate log analysis, incident diagnosis, report generation, and operator support workflows.
- Developed NLP components for retrieval, summarization, and entity extraction over structured and unstructured industrial data.
- Established comprehensive testing infrastructure to ensure reliability, maintainability, and reproducibility.

### Institute for Employment Research (IAB) — Research Assistant  
*Nov 2024 – Present · Nuremberg, Germany*

- Applied supervised and semi-supervised learning techniques, including **PU Learning (Elkan & Noto, Two-Step Strategy)**, for labor market analysis.
- Built scalable data pipelines and feature engineering workflows over **90M+ employment records**.
- Developed predictive models to support job matching and labor market forecasting.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis, visualization, and contributed to academic writing and documentation.
